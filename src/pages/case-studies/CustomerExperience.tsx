            summary="Implementing an AI-powered customer experience platform that increased satisfaction scores by 45%."
            challenge="The telecommunications provider was facing increasing customer churn and declining satisfaction scores. Their customer service operations were fragmented across multiple channels, with inconsistent experiences and long resolution times. They lacked a unified view of customer interactions and couldn't effectively personalize service or anticipate customer needs."
            solution="We created a comprehensive customer experience platform powered by AI. The system unifies all customer interaction channels (phone, chat, email, social media) and provides agents with real-time recommendations based on customer history and predictive analytics. It includes sentiment analysis to gauge customer emotions, automatic categorization of issues, and proactive outreach for potential problems detected in network data. We also implemented a self-service portal with an advanced conversational AI assistant."
